# Implemented the Research Paper MemoryBank: Enhancing Large Language Models with Long-Term Memory

I have read the research paper and source code for MemoryBank: Enhancing Large Language Models with Long-Term Memory, and I have implemented the paper's concepts. I am sharing my findings in this repository.

The research paper can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10250.
The research's GitHub page can be found here: https://github.com/zhongwanjun/MemoryBank-SiliconFriend.

## Summary of the Research Paper:

This research paper introduces and demonstrates the Memory Retrieval Mechanism, enabling long-term memory for both open-source and closed-source LLMs. Long-term memory is useful in scenarios requiring sustained interaction, such as personal companion systems, psychological counseling and secretarial assistance.

## Reproduced the Memory Retrieval Mechanism Discussed in the Paper:

I have implemented the Memory Retrieval Mechanism discussed in the paper in a Jupyter Notebook:

## What I Learned through this Experience:

It was such an exciting experience to see my bot remember our past conversations! This opens up so many possibilities in terms of technical variety and potential applications, and I can't wait to explore them further.

## What is Next?:

I am working on building a robot to practice spoken languages with. This Memory Retrieval Mechanism will be extremely useful in making the robot seem more human-like, which should contribute to a more effective language-learning experience!

## Notes for Future Learning:

In this reproduction, I used LlamaIndex for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); however, next time I would like to explore using LangChain.

Additionally, although I didn't need it for my current use case, I am intellectually curious about the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve theory and its potential for implementing a forgetting mechanism. This could create even more human-like interactions, and I look forward to exploring that.

## Conclusion:

Thank you so much for making this wonderful research paper and code publicly available. I have learned so much from this experience, and I also wish to contribute to this field myself in the future.
